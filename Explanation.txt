Steev is a building a weather app, so he wants a algorithm to calculate 
the day of next warmth day than the current day, so he is asking you to 
frame the algorithm.
the temperature is given in the array you have to say that,
how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. 
If there is no future day for which this is possible, put 0 instead
Constraint: The length of temperatures will be in the range [1, 30000]. 
Each temperature will be an integer in the range [30, 100]

Input Description:
Temperature in array

Output description:
how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature.

Sample Input:
67 78 92 56 47 63

Sample Output:
1 1 0 2 1 0

Explanation:
for the first temperature 67, we have to wait for 1 day to get next warmth day likewise,
for 78-> 92 (1 day)
for 92 (no days warmth than that)
for 56-> 47,63 (2 days)
for 47 -> 63 (1 day)
for 63 (no days)

Sample Input:
23 12 45 78 74 76 99

Sample Output:
2 1 1 3 1 1 0

Sample Input:
34 56 72 33 45 12 9

Sample Output:
1 1 0 1 0 0 0

Sample Input:
56 74 23 99 77 66

Sample Output:
1 2 1 0 0 0

Sample Input:
33 76 12 18 15 19

Sample Output:
1 0 1 2 1 0
